# Personal Website
This is my personal website. It was created to emulate an old-school terminal.

It was written with minimalism in mind. As such, it is designed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and external JS libraries in decreasing importance and quantities, [as the web should be](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm). In fact, no external libraries are used; it's just plain vanilla JavaScript! As a result, load times are extremely fast.
