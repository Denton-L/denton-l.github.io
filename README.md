# Personal Website
This is my personal website. It was created to emulate an old CRT terminal.

It was written with minimalism in mind. As such, it is designed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and external JS libraries in decreasing importance and quantities, [as the web should be](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm). In fact, jQuery is only used on one page. The rest of the pages run on vanilla JavaScript! As a result, load times are extremely fast.
