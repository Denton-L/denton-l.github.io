        Hello, my name is Denton Liu and I am a student studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo! As a developer, I have a wide breadth of experience in many fields, including embedded development, security, DevOps, cryptocurrencies and Big Data, with job experience to back it up. Also, I hate front-end development.
