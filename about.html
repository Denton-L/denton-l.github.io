				Hello, my name is Denton Liu and I am a student studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo!
				</p>
				<p>
				As a developer, I like to understand how systems work from the inside out. I have spent many lazy days curling up in front of a fireplace and learning about the plumbing of Git, writing assembly for the JVM in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmin_(software)">Jasmin</a> or just learning about how x86 architecture works. I especially enjoy working in embedded environments because it gives me a chance interact directly without any abstractions that may obscure how the internals really work. More importantly, though, I believe that understanding how systems work "under the hood" allows me to write better code even in a higher-level environment.
				</p>
				<p>
				I live in Kanata, Ontario although I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. I attended high school at Martingrove Collegiate Institute where I took a computer science course in grade ten and I fell in love with programming. I enrolled in more computer engineering and computer science courses throughout my high school career which allowed me to develop my interest and skills. 
				</p>
				<p>
				When I am not sitting in front of my computer, I like to keep myself entertained by doing various things. Music is a big part of my life; I am a pianist, cellist and double bassist. If I am not inside making music, I am probably outside unicycling. Back in grade seven, I picked up unicycling as a challenge for myself and since then, I use my unicycle as a convenient form of transportation and also as a form of recreation. (Mountain unicycling!) Finally, I also enjoy cooking a lot. My signature dishes include steamed lobster but I find that dishes that are improvised are the most fun to make. Of course, the best part of cooking is having a delicious meal to eat at the end!
				</p>
				<p>
				A little note about this website, it was built with minimalism in mind. Websites these days tend to be quite <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">bloated</a>. I sought to avoid this by avoiding dependencies as much as possible. In fact, jQuery is only used on the Projects page. Everywhere else, only vanilla JavaScript is used. This keeps the amount of content that needs to be loaded to a minimum. In addition to this, I attempted to use HTML and CSS as much as possible before resorting to JavaScript. This way, the browser can do what it does best, which is rendering HTML and CSS.
